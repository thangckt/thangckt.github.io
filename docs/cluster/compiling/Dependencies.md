# Some Dependencies

## LAPACK & BLAS

Two of the most commonly used computational libraries are LAPACK and BLAS.  They are super fast in doing linear algebra operations involving matrices and vectors.

- BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations.
- LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) is written in Fortran 90 and provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems.
- BLAS is needed in LAPACK. BLAS & LAPACK can be installed separately. First, you have to install BLAS before LAPACK, because LAPACK needs it. Download the packages from the following websites. ([see here](https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/jild13/2016/07/27/install-lapack-and-blas-on-linux-based-systems/) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63600714/how-to-build-blas-and-lapack-for-use-in-c-on-linux-cluster))
  - BLAS, see [http://www.netlib.org/blas/]
  - LAPACK, see [http://www.netlib.org/lapack/]
- Or can install LAPACK by cmake, where [soureCode LAPACK](https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack) also includes BLAS

### install LAPACK with cmake

- see CMAKE options in file CMakeLists.txt,
- This way also install BLAS, CBLAS, LAPACKE, set `-DCBLAS=on -DLAPACKE=on`

```shell
tar -xvf lapack-3.10.0.tar.gz
cd lapack-3.10.0
mkdir build && cd build
```

```shell
module load tool_dev/cmake-3.21
module load compiler/gcc-11.2
export PATH=/uhome/p001cao/local/app/compiler/gcc-11.2/bin:$PATH
export CC=gcc  export CXX=g++  export FC=gfortran
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/uhome/p001cao/local/app/compiler/gcc-11.2/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

export myInstallDIR=/uhome/p001cao/local/app/lapack-3.10

cmake .. -DCBLAS=on -DLAPACKE=on \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=${myInstallDIR} \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR=${myInstallDIR}

make -j 8
make install
```

### usage

```shell
export myLAPACK=/uhome/p001cao/local/app/lapack-3.10/liblapack.a
export myLAPACKE=/uhome/p001cao/local/app/lapack-3.10/liblapacke.a
export myBLAS=/uhome/p001cao/local/app/lapack-3.10/libblas.a
export myCBLAS=/uhome/p001cao/local/app/lapack-3.10/libcblas.a
```

## ScaLAPACK

ScaLAPACK (Scalable LAPACK) is a library of high-performance linear algebra routines for parallel distributed memory machines. ScaLAPACK can be used as a replacement for both LAPACK and BLAS

- Installing ScaLAPACK needs BLAS, LAPACK and BLACS libraries. (BLACS now included inside ScaLAPACK)
- ScaLAPACK now only supports MPI.
- Installation docs of ScaLAPACK [here](http://netlib.org/scalapack/scalapack_installer/README)
- Some guide [here](https://gitlab.com/arm-hpc/packages/-/wikis/packages/scalapack)
- [SouceCode](https://github.com/Reference-ScaLAPACK/scalapack)
- see CMAKE options in file CMakeLists.txt

???+ note
    ScaLAPACK just be compiled by MPI compilers

### Download

```shell
cd /home1/p001cao/local/wSourceCode/tooldev
git clone -b tags/v2.2.1 https://github.com/Reference-ScaLAPACK/scalapack.git ScaLAPACK-2.2.1
cd ScaLAPACK-2.2.1
mkdir build && cd build
```

- Or download release

```shell
tar -xvf scalapack-2.1.0.tar.gz
cd scalapack-2.1.0
mkdir build && cd build
```

### self-build BLAS and LAPACK

```shell
module load tooldev/cmake-3.24
module load mpi/ompi4.1.x-clang14

export PATH=/home1/p001cao/local/app/openmpi/4.1.x-clang14/bin:$PATH
export CC=mpicc  export CXX=mpic++  export F90=mpif90 export F77=mpif77
```

```shell
cmake .. -DUSE_OPTIMIZED_LAPACK_BLAS=on \
-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=mpifort \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home1/p001cao/local/app/tooldev/ScaLAPACK-2.2

make -j 16 && make install
```

### preinstall BLAS and LAPACK

```shell
export myLAPACK=/uhome/p001cao/local/app/lapack-3.10/liblapack.a
export myBLAS=/uhome/p001cao/local/app/lapack-3.10/libblas.a

cmake .. -DBLAS_LIBRARIES=${myBLAS} -DLAPACK_LIBRARIES=${myLAPACK} \
-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=mpifort \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home1/p001cao/local/app/tooldev/ScaLAPACK-2.2
```

**Some options if errors**

```shell
export CFLAGS="-Ofast -march=x86-64"
export FFLAGS="-Ofast -march=x86-64 -fallow-argument-mismatch"
export FFLAGS="-std=legacy"
```

**Module file**

```tcl
set     topdir          /home1/p001cao/local/app/tooldev/ScaLAPACK-2.2

prepend-path    LD_LIBRARY_PATH     $topdir/lib
prepend-path    PKG_CONFIG_PATH     $topdir/lib/pkgconfig
```
