# Jupyterlab
```note
- Should use python 3.10 in base_env
- Jupyterlab is now availabe as a [Desktop App](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop)
```

## 1. Install

**conda 
```shell
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

**pip
```shell
pip install jupyterlab
```

**from source
```shell
pip install git+git://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab.git@master
conda install -c conda-forge json5
```


## 2. Use multil envs in Notebook
```note
- To use multi python in jupyterlab:
  + Install conda install -n base nb_conda_kernels in base-env
  + Install jyterlab in both base-env and slave-env
  + select to open notebook by jupyterlab in base-env
- To solve conflict DLL when use different python vers, remove PYTHONPATH environment variables
```

```shell
(base)$ conda install -n base nb_conda_kernels
## create new env
conda create -n py37mbuild python=3.7
conda activate py37mbuild
conda install jupyterlab
```

Then we can select env in jupyterlab:
- change kernel (this will be save for the next open of .ipynb file)

### remove a kernel
```
jupyter kernelspec list
jupyter kernelspec uninstall unwanted-kernel
```

## 4. Jupyterlab as Desktop App
JupyterLab App is the cross-platform standalone application distribution of JupyterLab. It is a self-contained desktop application which bundles a Python environment with several popular Python libraries ready to use in scientific computing and data science workflows.

## configuration files
https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop#configuration-files

```tip
- To use multi envs in App, remember to choose PYTHON-path as the base-env conda. Can change this by change "pythonPath" is this file:
%APPDATA%\jupyterlab-desktop\jupyterlab-desktop-data
- App version may not compatible with some plot packages, not good as web version
```
